## 📝 What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug: Login Flow Race Condition
**Problem:**
- After successful login, users were redirected to homepage but saw "Sign in/Sign up" buttons instead of their profile
- The authentication state wasn't immediately recognized
- Users had to wait or switch tabs for the session to be recognized

**Root Cause:**
- Login page used `router.push()` for navigation after successful login
- This performed a soft navigation without full page reload
- `AuthContext` didn't refresh to load new session data from cookies before rendering

**Solution:**
Changed from:
```typescript
// Old approach - unreliable
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
router.refresh();
router.push(redirectTo);
```

To:
```typescript
// New approach - reliable
window.location.href = redirectTo;
```

**Why This Works:**
- `window.location.href` triggers full browser navigation
- Entire page reloads from scratch
- `AuthContext` runs initialization code again
- Cookies properly read and session established
- User sees correct logged-in state immediately

### Missing Routes Fixed
Created three new pages to eliminate 404 errors:

1. **`/profile`** - User Profile Page
   - Displays user avatar, name, username, email
   - Shows account status and verification state
   - Member since date
   - Lists planned features

2. **`/settings`** - Settings Page
   - Account settings (email, password)
   - Notification preferences
   - Privacy controls
   - Danger zone (account deletion)
   - All with "coming soon" messaging

3. **`/my-comments`** - Comment History Page
   - Empty state with friendly messaging
   - Link to browse articles
   - Lists planned comment features
