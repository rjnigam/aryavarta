## 🔧 Supabase Configuration Required

### Auth Redirect URLs
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration, ensure:

**Site URL:**
```
https://arya-varta.in
```

**Redirect URLs (both required):**
```
https://arya-varta.in/auth/callback
https://www.arya-varta.in/auth/callback
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Verification

### Email Templates
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates:

- ✅ Confirmation email template active
- ⚠️ Verify redirect URL uses `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`

---

## 📧 Resend Email Configuration

### Domain Setup
In Resend Dashboard (https://resend.com):

1. **Domain:** arya-varta.in
   - Status: ⚠️ Needs Verification
   
2. **SPF Record:** 
   ```
   v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   ```
   - Status: ⚠️ Needs DNS Configuration

3. **DKIM Records:**
   - Status: ⚠️ Needs DNS Configuration

**Impact:** Email verification may not work until DNS records are configured.

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Rate Limits
- **Supabase:** 4 verification emails per hour per email address
- **Resend:** Based on your plan (check dashboard)

### Cookie Settings
- Currently configured for development (`secure: false`)
- HTTPS automatically makes cookies secure in production
- Consider updating for explicit `secure: true` in production

### First-Time Login
- Slightly slower due to subscriber record creation
- Uses service role key when RLS blocks initial creation
- Normal behavior, not a bug
