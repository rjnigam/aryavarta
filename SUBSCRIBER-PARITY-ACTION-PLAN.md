# Subscriber Profile Parity - Ready to Run! 🚀

## What We Just Built

I've created a **complete migration system** to sync your subscribers table with Supabase Auth. This fixes the "subscriber profile parity" item from your roadmap.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Open Supabase
Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/yrwkufkhusfwikyfaime

### 2. Run the Migration
1. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
2. Click **New Query**
3. Open `/docs/SUBSCRIBER-PROFILE-PARITY.sql` in your project
4. Copy all the SQL code
5. Paste into Supabase
6. Click **Run** ▶️

### 3. Watch the Output
You'll see messages showing:
- How many subscribers were linked to auth accounts
- How many email statuses were synced
- Final success confirmation ✅

That's it! The migration is **completely automated** and **safe to run** (it only updates, never deletes).

## What This Fixes

### Before ❌
- Subscribers and auth.users could be out of sync
- email_verified might not match actual verification status
- Missing auth_user_id links for older users
- Manual syncing needed

### After ✅
- Every subscriber linked to their auth account
- Email verification status always accurate  
- Automatic sync for all future users
- No more manual data fixes needed

## Expected Results

After running, you should see:

```
FINAL STATE AFTER MIGRATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Total subscribers: 15
Subscribers with auth_user_id: 15
Email verified: 12
Email not verified: 3
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ SUCCESS: All subscribers linked to auth.users!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

(Your numbers will vary based on actual data)

---

## Test It Works

After running the migration, test with a new signup:

1. Create a new account on arya-varta.in
2. Verify your email
3. Run this query in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  username,
  auth_user_id IS NOT NULL as has_auth_link,
  email_verified
FROM subscribers
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Should show:
- ✅ New user has `has_auth_link` = true
- ✅ `email_verified` = true after verification
- ✅ All automatic!

## Next Steps After This

Once you run this migration, you've completed **"Subscriber profile parity"** from your Immediate roadmap! 🎉

Next suggested priorities:
1. **Launch verification UX polish** - Add status banners, retry cooldowns
2. **Analytics setup** - Enable Vercel Analytics or Plausible
3. **Content tooling** - Automate article QA checklist
