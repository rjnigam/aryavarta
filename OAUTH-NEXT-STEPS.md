## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### "OAuth provider not configured" error
**Solution:** Make sure you saved and enabled the provider in Supabase

### "Redirect URI mismatch" error  
**Solution:** Verify redirect URI in Google matches exactly:
`https://yrwkufkhusfwikyfaime.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### OAuth succeeds but can't comment
**Solution:** Check if subscriber record was created in Supabase

### Want to revoke credentials
**Solution:** Go to Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Delete OAuth client
