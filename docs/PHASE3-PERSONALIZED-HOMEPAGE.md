# Phase 3: Personalized Homepage with Article Tracking

## Problem Solved
After logging in and commenting, users were still seeing the newsletter subscription form on the homepage, which was redundant and annoying. They needed a personalized experience showing their reading progress and recommended unread articles.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema - Article View Tracking
**File**: `docs/PHASE3-ARTICLE-TRACKING-MIGRATION.sql`

Created `article_views` table to track which articles each user has read:
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `user_email` (VARCHAR) - Foreign key to subscribers table
- `article_slug` (VARCHAR) - Article identifier
- `viewed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When the article was viewed
- Unique constraint on (user_email, article_slug) to prevent duplicate views
- Indexes on user_email, article_slug, and viewed_at for performance
- RLS policies for data security

### 2. Backend APIs

#### Track Article Views
**File**: `app/api/track-view/route.ts`
- POST endpoint to record when a user views an article
- Validates user is an active subscriber
- Uses UPSERT to handle duplicate views (updates viewed_at)
- Called automatically after 3 seconds of reading an article

#### Get Unread Articles
**File**: `app/api/unread-articles/route.ts`
- GET endpoint that returns unread articles for a user
- Fetches user's view history from database
- Filters all articles to find unread ones
- Returns: unreadArticles[], readCount, totalArticles

### 3. Frontend Components

#### ArticleViewTracker
**File**: `components/ArticleViewTracker.tsx`
- Client component that tracks article views
- Checks if user is authenticated via localStorage
- Waits 3 seconds before tracking (ensures actual reading)
- Silently fails if user is not logged in
- Integrated into article page template

#### PersonalizedHero
**File**: `components/PersonalizedHero.tsx`
- Replaces generic homepage hero for logged-in users
- Three states:
  1. **Not authenticated**: Shows standard subscribe CTA
  2. **Authenticated with unread articles**: Shows personalized recommendation card
  3. **All articles read**: Shows congratulations message

Features:
- Welcome message with username
- Reading progress (X of Y articles read)
- Random unread article recommendation with:
  - Full title, excerpt, category, date
  - "Read Article" CTA button
  - "Browse All Articles" secondary button
- Progress bar showing % of articles read
- Beautiful gradient design matching brand

### 4. Integration Points

Updated `app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`:
- Added ArticleViewTracker component
- Tracks views for authenticated users only

Updated `app/page.tsx`:
- Replaced static hero section with PersonalizedHero component
- Maintains all original design elements for non-authenticated users

## User Experience Flow

### For Non-Authenticated Users:
1. Homepage shows standard subscribe CTA
2. No tracking occurs

### For Authenticated Users:
1. **First Visit After Login**:
   - Homepage shows "Welcome back, [username]!"
   - Displays random unread article recommendation
   - Shows reading progress (0 of 4 articles)

2. **Reading Articles**:
   - After 3 seconds on article page, view is tracked
   - View recorded in database with timestamp

3. **Return to Homepage**:
   - Progress updates automatically
   - New random unread article recommended
   - Progress bar shows visual completion

4. **All Articles Read**:
   - Special congratulations message
   - Invitation to revisit articles
   - No annoying subscribe prompts

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Each user gets a unique homepage experience
2. **No Redundancy**: Logged-in users don't see subscribe forms
3. **Engagement**: Progress tracking encourages completing the collection
4. **Discovery**: Random recommendations expose users to all content
5. **Retention**: Users feel recognized and valued ("Welcome back!")

## Technical Highlights

- **Privacy**: Only tracks authenticated subscribers
- **Performance**: Indexed database queries, client-side caching
- **Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks if APIs fail
- **Scalability**: UPSERT prevents duplicate records
- **UX**: 3-second delay ensures genuine reading interest
