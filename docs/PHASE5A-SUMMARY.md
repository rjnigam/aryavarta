# Phase 5A: Comment Reactions (Like/Dislike) - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Reaction System with Smart Rules**
- **Like/Dislike buttons** on every comment
- **Toggle behavior**: Click again to remove your reaction
- **Switch reactions**: Click opposite button to change like ↔ dislike
- **No self-reactions**: Users cannot react to their own comments
- **One reaction per user**: Database constraint ensures uniqueness

### 2. **Visual Design**

if liked if disliked button
```

**States:**
- **Not reacted**: Gray icons, clickable
- **Liked**: Orange/saffron filled thumbs up
- **Disliked**: Red filled thumbs down
- **Own comment**: Shows counts only, no buttons
- **Not authenticated**: Shows counts only, no buttons

### 3. **Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE comment_reactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  comment_id UUID REFERENCES comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  reaction_type TEXT CHECK (reaction_type IN ('like', 'dislike')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(comment_id, user_email)  -- One reaction per user per comment
);
```

### 4. **API Endpoints**

**GET `/api/comments/reactions?commentId=xxx&userEmail=yyy`**
- Returns: `{ likeCount, dislikeCount, userReaction }`
- Used for fetching reaction data

**POST `/api/comments/reactions`**
- Body: `{ commentId, userEmail, reactionType, commentAuthorEmail }`
- Actions:
  - **Add**: If no existing reaction
  - **Remove**: If clicking same reaction again (toggle)
  - **Update**: If switching like ↔ dislike
- Validates: No self-reactions allowed

### 5. **Frontend Logic**

**Comment Interface Updated:**
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;  // NEW - for preventing self-reactions
  comment_text: string;
  created_at: string;
  replies?: Comment[];
  likeCount?: number;        // NEW
  dislikeCount?: number;     // NEW
  userReaction?: 'like' | 'dislike' | null;  // NEW
}
```

**Reaction Flow:**
1. User clicks like/dislike button
2. `handleReaction()` called with commentId, reactionType, commentAuthorEmail
3. API validates no self-reaction
4. Check for existing reaction:
   - Same type → Remove (toggle off)
   - Different type → Update (switch)
   - None → Add new
5. Reload comments to show updated counts
6. UI updates with new state

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (5 min)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `/docs/PHASE5A-REACTIONS-MIGRATION.sql`
3. Click "Run"
4. Verify table created successfully

### Step 2: Test Locally (10 min)

```bash
# Dev server should already be running, refresh browser
# Or restart:
npm run dev
```

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ **Like a comment** (not your own)
   - Click thumbs up
   - Icon becomes filled/orange
   - Count increases by 1

2. ✅ **Toggle like off**
   - Click thumbs up again
   - Icon becomes unfilled/gray
   - Count decreases by 1

3. ✅ **Switch like to dislike**
   - Like a comment
   - Click thumbs down
   - Like count -1, dislike count +1
   - Dislike icon filled/red

4. ✅ **Try to react to own comment**
   - Post a comment
   - Notice no reaction buttons appear
   - Only see counts (if any)

5. ✅ **Reactions on nested replies**
   - Reply to a comment
   - React to the reply
   - Check parent comment reactions still work

6. ✅ **Not authenticated**
   - Logout
   - See comment counts but no buttons

### Step 3: Deploy to Production (5 min)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add like/dislike reactions to comments (Phase 5A)"
git push origin main
# Or: vercel --prod
```

---

## 🎯 Rules Enforced

### 1. **One Reaction Per User Per Comment**
```sql
CONSTRAINT unique_user_comment_reaction UNIQUE (comment_id, user_email)
```
Database prevents duplicate reactions.

### 2. **No Self-Reactions**
```typescript
if (commentAuthorEmail && userEmail === commentAuthorEmail) {
  return { message: 'You cannot react to your own comment', status: 403 };
}
```
API blocks self-reactions.

### 3. **Toggle Behavior**
```typescript
if (existingReaction.reaction_type === reactionType) {
  // Same reaction → Remove it
  DELETE reaction;
}
```

### 4. **Switch Behavior**
```typescript
if (existingReaction.reaction_type !== reactionType) {
  // Different reaction → Update it
  UPDATE reaction SET reaction_type = newType;
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations

**Database Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_reactions_comment_id ON comment_reactions(comment_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reactions_user_email ON comment_reactions(user_email);
CREATE INDEX idx_reactions_comment_type ON comment_reactions(comment_id, reaction_type);
```

**Fetching Strategy:**
- Reactions fetched recursively with comments
- `addReactionsToComment()` handles nested replies
- Parallel fetching with `Promise.all()`

**Count Calculation:**
```typescript
const likeCount = reactions.filter(r => r.reaction_type === 'like').length;
const dislikeCount = reactions.filter(r => r.reaction_type === 'dislike').length;
```

### UI States

| Condition | Like Button | Dislike Button | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Not authenticated | Hidden | Hidden | Show counts only |
| Own comment | Hidden | Hidden | Show counts only |
| Not reacted | Gray outline | Gray outline | Click to react |
| User liked | Orange filled | Gray outline | Click to unlike |
| User disliked | Gray outline | Red filled | Click to undislike |

## 📊 Data We're Gathering

This phase collects valuable engagement data:

1. **Like/Dislike Ratios**
   - Which comments resonate with readers?
   - What content generates debate?

2. **Engagement Patterns**
   - Do users mostly like or dislike?
   - Are reactions used more than replies?

3. **Spam Detection Data** (for Phase 5B)
   - Comments with extreme dislike ratios
   - Patterns of bot-like behavior
   - Community consensus on quality

**After 1-2 weeks**, analyze this data to:
- Set smart auto-hide thresholds
- Tune spam detection algorithm
- Identify false positive patterns

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

### Phase 5B: Auto-Moderation (Week 2)
Once we have real data:
- Implement auto-hide algorithm
- Add "show hidden comment" UI
- Tune thresholds based on false positives
- Hide comments with extreme dislike ratios

### Phase 5C: Report System (Week 3)
Add manual reporting:
- Report button with category selection
- Email notifications for reports
- Admin dashboard for review
- User trust/ban system

---

## 📁 Files Changed

### Created
- `/docs/PHASE5A-REACTIONS-MIGRATION.sql` - Database migration
- `/app/api/comments/reactions/route.ts` - Reaction API endpoints
- `/docs/PHASE5A-SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified
- `/components/CommentSection.tsx`:
  - Updated Comment interface with reaction fields
  - Added like/dislike button UI
  - Added `handleReaction()` function
  - Added `addReactionsToComment()` recursive helper
  - Updated `loadComments()` to fetch reactions

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Problem: Reactions not showing**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify migration ran successfully
- Check Supabase logs for RLS policy issues

**Problem: Can react multiple times**
- Check unique constraint exists on table
- Verify API is checking for existing reactions

**Problem: Can react to own comments**
- Verify `commentAuthorEmail` is passed to API
- Check API validation logic

**Problem: Counts not updating**
- Refresh browser after reaction
- Check `loadComments()` is being called after reaction
- Verify reaction was saved in database

---

## ✨ Success Metrics

Monitor after deployment:
- ✅ Reaction button click rate
- ✅ Like vs dislike ratio (overall)
- ✅ Comments with 0 reactions vs high engagement
- ✅ Toggle rate (users changing/removing reactions)
- ✅ Attempt rate for self-reactions (should be 0)

## 🆕 NEW FEATURES (Just Added!)

### 6. **Optimistic UI Updates** ⚡
- **Instant feedback**: UI updates immediately when you click
- **Background sync**: Server request happens asynchronously
- **Smart rollback**: Reverts changes if server request fails
- **Verification**: Syncs with server after 1 second to ensure accuracy

**Before:** Click → Wait 1-2 seconds → UI updates
**Now:** Click → UI updates instantly → Server syncs in background

### 7. **Collapsible Comment Threads** 📁
- **Default state**: All threads collapsed (only parent comment visible)
- **Toggle button**: "Show X replies" / "Hide X replies"
- **Visual indicators**: ChevronDown ↓ / ChevronUp ↑ icons
- **Reply count**: Shows how many replies are hidden
- **Recursive**: Works for nested reply chains
- **Session persistence**: State maintained during browsing

**UI Example:**

                        Expand thread
```

### 8. **Comment Sorting** 🔄
Three sorting options:
1. **Most Popular** (default) - By score (likes - dislikes)
2. **Newest First** - Most recent comments at top
3. **Oldest First** - Original chronological order

**UI Location:** Dropdown selector at top of comments list with icon

**Sorting Logic:**
```typescript
Most Popular: (likeCount - dislikeCount) DESC
Newest First: created_at DESC
Oldest First: created_at ASC
```

**Note:** Sorting only applies to top-level comments. Replies within threads remain chronological.

## 🔧 Updated Technical Details

### New Component State
```typescript
// Thread expansion tracking
const [expandedThreads, setExpandedThreads] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Sorting preference
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState<'popular' | 'newest' | 'oldest'>('popular');
```

### New Helper Functions
```typescript
// Toggle thread expansion
const toggleThread = (commentId: string) => {
  setExpandedThreads(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    if (newSet.has(commentId)) newSet.delete(commentId);
    else newSet.add(commentId);
    return newSet;
  });
};

// Sort comments by selected criteria
const getSortedComments = (comments: Comment[]): Comment[] => {
  switch (sortBy) {
    case 'popular': return [...comments].sort((a, b) => 
      ((b.likeCount || 0) - (b.dislikeCount || 0)) - 
      ((a.likeCount || 0) - (a.dislikeCount || 0))
    );
    case 'newest': return [...comments].sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(b.created_at).getTime() - new Date(a.created_at).getTime()
    );
    case 'oldest': return [...comments].sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(a.created_at).getTime() - new Date(b.created_at).getTime()
    );
  }
};

// Optimistic reaction update
const updateCommentReaction = (
  comments: Comment[],
  commentId: string,
  reactionType: 'like' | 'dislike',
  action: 'added' | 'removed' | 'updated',
  previousReaction: 'like' | 'dislike' | null
): Comment[] => {
  // Recursively updates comment and nested replies
  // Returns new array with updated counts and userReaction
};
```

### Updated UI Components
```tsx
{/* Sorting dropdown */}
<select value={sortBy} onChange={(e) => setSortBy(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="popular">Most Popular</option>
  <option value="newest">Newest First</option>
  <option value="oldest">Oldest First</option>
</select>

{/* Thread toggle button */}
{hasReplies && (
  <button onClick={() => onToggleThread(comment.id)}>
    {isExpanded ? (
      <><ChevronUp /> Hide {replies.length} replies</>
    ) : (
      <><ChevronDown /> Show {replies.length} replies</>
    )}
  </button>
)}
```
