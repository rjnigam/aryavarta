# Login Flow Fix - October 25, 2025

## Issue Description
After successful login, users were redirected to the homepage but the authentication state wasn't immediately recognized. The page showed "Sign in" and "Sign up" buttons instead of the logged-in user menu. The session would only be recognized after waiting or switching tabs.

Additionally, the browser console showed 404 errors for `/profile`, `/settings`, and `/my-comments` routes that didn't exist yet.

## Root Cause
The login page was using Next.js `router.push()` after a successful login, which performs a soft navigation that doesn't trigger a full page reload. This meant the `AuthContext` didn't have a chance to refresh and load the new session data from cookies before the page rendered.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Login Flow (`app/auth/login/page.tsx`)
**Changed from:**
```typescript
// Wait a moment for the session to propagate
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

// Success - refresh the page first, then redirect
router.refresh();
router.push(redirectTo);
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
// Force a full page reload to ensure AuthContext picks up the session
// This is more reliable than router.refresh() + router.push()
window.location.href = redirectTo;
```

**Why this works:**
- `window.location.href` triggers a full browser navigation
- This causes the entire page to reload from scratch
- `AuthContext` runs its initialization code again
- Cookies are properly read and session is established
- User sees the correct logged-in state immediately

### 2. Created Missing Routes
Created placeholder pages to eliminate 404 errors:

#### `/app/profile/page.tsx`
- Displays user profile information
- Shows account status and verification state
- Lists coming soon features

#### `/app/settings/page.tsx`
- Account settings UI (disabled/coming soon)
- Notification preferences
- Privacy settings
- Danger zone (account deletion)

#### `/app/my-comments/page.tsx`
- Empty state for when user has no comments
- Link to browse articles
- Lists planned features

All three pages include:
- Auth protection (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- Loading states
- User-friendly UI with Aryavarta's design system
- "Coming Soon" messaging for unimplemented features

## Testing
After these changes:
1. ✅ Login redirects immediately show correct auth state
2. ✅ No more 404 errors in console
3. ✅ User menu appears right away after login
4. ✅ No need to wait or switch tabs

## Files Modified
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Fixed login redirect
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Created profile page
- `app/settings/page.tsx` - Created settings page  
- `app/my-comments/page.tsx` - Created my comments page

## Impact
- **User Experience:** Much smoother login flow, no confusion
- **Support Burden:** Eliminates "I logged in but not seeing my profile" issues
- **Console Noise:** Cleaner browser console, easier debugging
- **Future Ready:** Placeholder pages ready for feature implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual settings functionality (password change, email change)
2. Connect my-comments page to comment database when that's built
3. Add profile editing capabilities
4. Consider adding loading animations for the full page reload
