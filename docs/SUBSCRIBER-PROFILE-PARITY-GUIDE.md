# Subscriber Profile Parity - Implementation Guide

## What This Fixes

Your subscribers table and Supabase Auth (`auth.users`) need to stay perfectly in sync. This migration ensures:

1. **Every subscriber is linked to their auth account** via `auth_user_id`
2. **Email verification status matches** between both tables
3. **Timestamps are consistent** across the system
4. **Future users auto-sync** via database triggers

---

## Background

You have two places storing user data:
- **Supabase Auth** (`auth.users`) - handles passwords, email verification
- **Subscribers table** - handles usernames, profiles, reading history

These must stay in sync, but older subscribers might not have proper links or verification statuses might be out of date.

---

## How to Run This Migration

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Migration

1. Open the file: `/docs/SUBSCRIBER-PROFILE-PARITY.sql`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**

### Step 3: Read the Output

The migration will show you:

```

## What the Migration Does

### Part 1: Verification
Checks current state and shows you problems before fixing them

### Part 2: Backfill auth_user_id
Links subscribers to their auth accounts by matching emails

### Part 3: Sync Email Verification
Updates `email_verified` to match what's in `auth.users.email_confirmed_at`

### Part 4: Fix Timestamps
Ensures all subscribers have `created_at` and `updated_at`

### Part 5: Verify Triggers
Checks that automatic sync triggers are installed and working

### Part 6: Final Verification
Shows you the final state and any remaining issues

---

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Case
All subscribers are linked, verification statuses match, triggers are active

### ⚠️ Partial Success
Some subscribers still don't have auth accounts - these are users from before password authentication was added. They'll need to:
- Create a password when they try to log in next
- Or receive a "complete your account" email

---

## After Running the Migration

### Test That It's Working

1. **Create a new test account:**
   ```bash
   # Visit your site and sign up with a new email
   # The trigger should automatically create a subscriber record
   ```

2. **Verify email and check sync:**
   ```sql
   -- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT 
     s.email,
     s.username,
     s.email_verified AS subscriber_verified,
     (au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL) AS auth_verified,
     s.auth_user_id IS NOT NULL AS has_link
   FROM subscribers s
   LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON s.auth_user_id = au.id
   ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Should see:**
   - ✅ `has_link` = true for all users
   - ✅ `subscriber_verified` = `auth_verified`
   - ✅ New signups automatically get subscriber records

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Some subscribers still missing auth_user_id

**Cause:** These users signed up before you added password authentication

**Solutions:**
1. **Do nothing** - They'll get linked when they create a password
2. **Send email** - Ask them to complete account setup
3. **Manual link** - If you know they have an account, link manually:
   ```sql
   UPDATE subscribers
   SET auth_user_id = (
     SELECT id FROM auth.users 
     WHERE email = subscribers.email
   )
   WHERE auth_user_id IS NULL
   AND email IN ('user@example.com');
   ```

### Issue: Verification status still mismatched

**Cause:** Timing issue or trigger not firing

**Solution:**
Run the sync again:
```sql
UPDATE subscribers s
SET email_verified = (au.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL)
FROM auth.users au
WHERE s.auth_user_id = au.id;
```

---

## Maintaining Sync Going Forward

The triggers you verified in Part 5 will automatically:

1. **Create subscriber record** when new user signs up
2. **Sync email verification** when user confirms email
3. **Update timestamps** when records change

You shouldn't need to run manual syncs again!

## Success Checklist

- [ ] Ran migration in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Saw success message for backfill
- [ ] All or most subscribers have `auth_user_id`
- [ ] Email verification statuses match
- [ ] Triggers exist and are active
- [ ] Tested with new signup (auto-creates subscriber)
- [ ] Tested email verification (auto-syncs status)

---

## Next Steps After This Migration

Once subscriber profile parity is complete, you can:

1. **Simplify your auth code** - No more manual syncing needed
2. **Add better analytics** - Trust that subscriber data is accurate
3. **Build new features** - Profile pages, reading history, etc.
4. **Launch verification UX** - Polish the email verification flow
