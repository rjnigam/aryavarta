# Karma System Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Design Specification

---

## Overview

The Karma System is the cultural foundation of Aryavarta, implementing digital karma (action-consequence) principles to reward dharmic behavior and discourage adharmic behavior. Unlike punitive moderation systems, this creates a **positive reinforcement loop** that shapes community culture.

---

## Core Philosophy

### Vedic Karma Principles

| Sanskrit Term | Meaning | Platform Implementation |
|---------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Karma** | Action | Comments, posts, votes |
| **Phala** | Fruit/Result | Karma points awarded |
| **Dharma** | Right action | Constructive, respectful discourse |
| **Adharma** | Wrong action | Toxic, destructive behavior |
| **Punya** | Merit | High karma, elevated status |
| **Papa** | Demerit | Low karma, limited privileges |
| **Moksha** | Liberation | Guru tier, trusted moderator |

### Design Principles

1. **Positive-First**: Reward good behavior more than punishing bad
2. **Transparent**: Users see why they got/lost points
3. **Fair**: Multiple signals, not just AI opinion
4. **Redeemable**: Always offer path to improvement
5. **Meaningful**: Benefits must be valuable
6. **Sustainable**: Can't be easily gamed

---

## Karma Calculation

### Multi-Signal Approach

Karma is calculated from **four weighted signals**:

```
Total Karma = (AI Score √ó 40%) + 
              (Community Score √ó 30%) + 
              (Engagement Score √ó 20%) + 
              (Moderation Bonus √ó 10%)
```

### Signal 1: AI Analysis (40% weight)

**Input:**
- Comment/post text
- Article context
- User history
- Time of day (spam pattern detection)

**Claude API Prompt:**
```
Analyze this contribution for dharmic qualities on a 1-10 scale:

TONE (Respectful even in disagreement)
- 10: Warm, respectful, acknowledges others
- 7: Neutral, professional, factual
- 4: Slightly dismissive or condescending
- 1: Hostile, insulting, attacking

CONSTRUCTIVENESS (Adds value to discussion)
- 10: New insights, evidence, helpful resources
- 7: Thoughtful perspective, builds on others
- 4: Vague agreement/disagreement, minimal effort
- 1: Derails discussion, pure negativity

THOUGHTFULNESS (Depth of engagement)
- 10: Nuanced, considers multiple angles, cites sources
- 7: Clear reasoning, specific examples
- 4: Surface-level, generic statements
- 1: One-liner, low effort

CONTENT: {comment_text}
CONTEXT: Discussion on "{article_title}"
USER HISTORY: Avg karma {avg_karma}, recent comments {recent_count}

Return JSON with scores and brief reasoning.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "tone": 8.5,
  "constructiveness": 9.0,
  "thoughtfulness": 7.5,
  "combined": 8.33,
  "reasoning": "Respectful disagreement with alternative sources provided...",
  "flags": [], // ["possible-sarcasm", "aggressive-language"]
  "suggested_karma": 12
}
```

**Scoring Formula:**
```typescript
const aiKarma = (
  (tone * 0.4) + 
  (constructiveness * 0.4) + 
  (thoughtfulness * 0.2)
);

// Map 1-10 to karma points
const baseKarma = Math.round(aiKarma); // 1-10 points
```

### Signal 2: Community Feedback (30% weight)

**Inputs:**
- Upvotes received
- Downvotes received
- "Helpful" flags
- "Not helpful" flags
- Replies generated
- Bookmark/save counts

**Calculation:**
```typescript
const netVotes = upvotes - downvotes;
const helpfulRatio = helpful / (helpful + notHelpful);
const engagementBonus = replies > 3 ? 2 : 0;

const communityKarma = Math.min(
  Math.round(netVotes * 0.5 + helpfulRatio * 3 + engagementBonus),
  15 // cap at 15 points
);
```

**Time Decay:**
```typescript
// Votes in first hour worth more (prevents pile-on)
const hoursSincePost = (now - posted_at) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
const timeMultiplier = hoursSincePost < 1 ? 1.5 : 1.0;

communityKarma *= timeMultiplier;
```

### Signal 3: Engagement Quality (20% weight)

**Metrics:**
- Reply depth (conversation sparked?)
- Time between posts (thoughtful vs spam?)
- Edit history (willingness to improve?)
- Read time before commenting (actually read article?)

**Calculation:**
```typescript
const engagementKarma = (
  (replyDepth > 2 ? 3 : 0) +
  (timeSinceLastComment > 300 ? 2 : 0) + // 5 min minimum
  (hasEdits ? 1 : 0) +
  (readTimePercent > 50 ? 2 : 0)
);

// Max 8 points from engagement
```

### Signal 4: Moderation Bonus/Penalty (10% weight)

**Bonuses:**
- No moderation flags: +2
- Resolved reports favorably: +5
- Editorial pick: +20
- Community recognition award: +10

**Penalties:**
- Auto-moderation flag: -5
- Manual hide: -10
- Repeat offense: -20
- Ban: -50 (and reset to 0)

**Special Cases:**
```typescript
// Thoughtful Dissent Bonus
if (minorityOpinion && highAiScore && negativeVotes) {
  moderationBonus += 15; // "Devil's Advocate" award
}

// Diversity Bonus
if (commentsAcrossMultipleTopics) {
  moderationBonus += 5;
}
```

### Final Karma Calculation

```typescript
function calculateKarma(signals: KarmaSignals): KarmaResult {
  const {
    aiScore,           // 1-10
    communityScore,    // 0-15
    engagementScore,   // 0-8
    moderationBonus    // -50 to +20
  } = signals;
  
  // Weighted combination
  const rawKarma = (
    (aiScore * 0.40) +
    (communityScore * 0.30) +
    (engagementScore * 0.20) +
    (moderationBonus * 0.10)
  );
  
  // Apply diminishing returns (anti-gaming)
  const todayComments = getUserCommentsToday(userId);
  const diminishingFactor = Math.max(0.2, 1 - (todayComments * 0.05));
  
  const finalKarma = Math.round(rawKarma * diminishingFactor);
  
  // Bounds check
  return Math.max(-50, Math.min(50, finalKarma));
}
```

## Anti-Gaming Measures

### Diminishing Returns

```typescript
// First 10 actions of the day worth full value
// Each subsequent action worth less
function applyDiminishingReturns(
  baseKarma: number, 
  actionsToday: number
): number {
  if (actionsToday <= 10) return baseKarma;
  
  const excessActions = actionsToday - 10;
  const penalty = Math.min(0.8, excessActions * 0.05);
  
  return Math.round(baseKarma * (1 - penalty));
}
```

### Variety Bonus

```typescript
// Reward engagement across different topics
function calculateVarietyBonus(userActivity: Activity): number {
  const uniqueArticles = new Set(
    userActivity.comments.map(c => c.article_slug)
  ).size;
  
  const uniqueTopics = new Set(
    userActivity.posts.flatMap(p => p.tags)
  ).size;
  
  const varietyScore = uniqueArticles + (uniqueTopics * 2);
  
  return Math.min(10, Math.floor(varietyScore / 5));
}
```

### Pattern Detection

```typescript
// Detect suspicious patterns
function detectGamingPatterns(user: User): GamePattern[] {
  const patterns: GamePattern[] = [];
  
  // Rapid-fire commenting
  if (commentsIn5Min > 10) {
    patterns.push({
      type: 'rapid_fire',
      severity: 'medium',
      action: 'flag_for_review'
    });
  }
  
  // Copy-paste detection
  if (commentSimilarity > 0.8) {
    patterns.push({
      type: 'duplicate_content',
      severity: 'high',
      action: 'invalidate_karma'
    });
  }
  
  // Vote manipulation
  if (votesFromSameIP > 5) {
    patterns.push({
      type: 'vote_manipulation',
      severity: 'critical',
      action: 'suspend_account'
    });
  }
  
  return patterns;
}
```

### Shadow Karma

```typescript
// Real karma vs displayed karma
interface KarmaState {
  displayedKarma: number;  // What user sees
  actualKarma: number;      // What we calculate
  shadowBonus: number;      // Hidden adjustment
  lastRecalc: Date;
}

// Recalculate periodically with hidden signals
function recalculateKarma(userId: string): void {
  const signals = gatherAllSignals(userId);
  const actual = calculateActualKarma(signals);
  const shadow = calculateShadowAdjustment(userId);
  
  updateKarmaState(userId, {
    actualKarma: actual,
    shadowBonus: shadow,
    displayedKarma: actual + shadow
  });
}
```
