# Project Operations Hub

_Last updated: October 25, 2025_

This folder centralizes the living documentation for Aryavarta's engineering and product operations. Use it to understand where the project stands today, where it is heading next, and which risks require attention.

## Quick Snapshot

- **Product status:** Production site live at [arya-varta.in](https://arya-varta.in)
- **Current focus:** Hardening authentication + email flows, preparing for community features
- **Maintainers:** Core team @ Aryavarta (contact: contact@arya-varta.in)

## Document Map

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `vision.md` | Long-term mission, target audience, and product principles |
| `progress-history.md` | Chronological log of milestones, feature deliveries, and recent fixes |
| `roadmap.md` | Planned enhancements grouped by priority horizon |
| `issues-risks.md` | Open issues, risks, and recommended mitigations |
| `operations.md` | Environment configuration, tooling, and day-to-day runbook notes |

Each document is designed to stand alone while cross-referencing related work. Update them whenever a milestone ships, a new risk appears, or priorities shift so the next engineer can ramp up in minutes.
