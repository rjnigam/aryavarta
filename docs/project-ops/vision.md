# Product Vision & Principles

_Last updated: October 25, 2025_

## Mission Statement

Aryavarta exists to make classical Indian philosophy approachable for modern seekers. The platform distills primary texts (Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, allied commentaries) into rigorous, empathetic explanations that people can apply to their contemporary lives.

## Target Audience

1. **Knowledge seekers** looking for structured, well-researched introductions to Sanatan philosophy.
2. **Diaspora professionals** seeking ethical and spiritual grounding without sectarian baggage.
3. **Educators and content creators** who need reliable, citation-backed references.
4. **Existing subscribers** who already resonate with long-form essays and want a community anchored in respectful discourse.

## Product Pillars

- **Scholarly Rigor:** Every article cites canonical sources, Sanskrit terms, and academic references. Editorial standards are codified in `CONTENT_GUIDE.md`.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Language deliberately avoids dogma; visuals follow saffron/vermillion palette inspired by dharmic aesthetics.
- **Accessible Design:** Next.js 16 + Tailwind deliver fast, responsive reading across devices. Typography (Crimson Text + Inter) optimizes long-form readability.
- **Community Readiness:** Subscriber records, comment scaffolding, moderation APIs, and username infrastructure are in place to support interactive features.

## Definition of Success

- **Subscriber Growth:** 1,000 engaged subscribers (≥40% open rate) within 6 months.
- **Content Velocity:** Publish at least one high-quality, citation-backed feature weekly.
- **Community Health:** Maintain respectful comment sections with <2% of posts requiring moderator intervention, thanks to the Phase 5 moderation work.
- **Operational Excellence:** Zero high-severity incidents arising from auth/email flows; clear on-call runbooks for production issues.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Teach, don’t preach.** Every experience should emphasize philosophy over proselytizing.
2. **Trust through transparency.** Share sources, explain moderation decisions, and publish progress updates.
3. **Automate responsibly.** Use automation (Resend, Supabase, moderation scripts) to augment—not replace—editorial judgment.
4. **Design for longevity.** Codify decisions in docs, write deterministic scripts, and maintain clear deployment processes to keep the platform maintainable as the team grows.
