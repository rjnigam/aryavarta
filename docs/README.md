# Aryavarta 2.0 Documentation

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** Vision & Specifications Complete - Ready for Development

## üéØ What is Aryavarta?

Aryavarta is a revolutionary platform that flips the traditional news and social media model:
- **AI researches and synthesizes** news from multiple sources
- **Human editors** apply wisdom and verify accuracy  
- **Community discusses** with dharmic principles guiding behavior
- **Karma system** rewards good behavior and shapes culture

We're not using AI to fact-check journalists. We're using AI to eliminate bias at the research stage, then adding human wisdom and community discussion.
